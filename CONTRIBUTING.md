## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, please make sure that you have read the available [Documentation](https://ki365.github.io/docs).

Also, before asking a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/ki365/ki365/issues) that might be similar. In case you have found a suitable issue upvote so we know which issues are impacting users the most.

If all else fails, you can do the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/ki365/ki365/issues/new).
- Fill out the issue template completely.
- Wait for a response from a lead developer or community support.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Before Submitting a Bug Report

Before submitting a bug report, we ask if you can investigate the issue carefully. After gathering this information, please complete the following steps:

- Search for any similar issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ki365/ki365issues?q=label%3Abug). This is so you can determine if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the issue you are having.
- Make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect any pertinent information about the bug or error:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

> IMPORTANT NOTICE: You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to the lead developer.

## Suggesting Enhancements

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://ki365.github.io/docs) carefully and make sure the functionality is not already covered.
- Perform an [issue search](https://github.com/ki365/ki365/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, upvote and/or add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's lead developers and community of the merits of your feature.

### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ki365/ki365/issues).

- Use a **descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead**. You can also describe which alternatives did not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which can help demonstrate the proposed feature.
- You **must** explain why this enhancement would be useful to **most** Ki365 users. You may also want to point out how other projects have solved the problem and may serve as inspiration.
